# easy-rte

## About
This project provides an easy-to-use implementation of _bi-directional Runtime Enforcement_, based on the semantics originally presented in [Runtime Enforcement of Cyber-Physical Systems](https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/citation.cfm?id=3126500) (ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS) 2017).

While the original implementation was restricted to simple _boolean_ arguments only, and was implemented in Python for use 
with SCCharts, this project presents a more generalised any-type enforcement system, which can be used with any C project. 
_easy-rte_ was ported from [goFB](https://github.com/PRETgroup/goFB), which implemented the semantics in this way, but restricted them for use with IEC 61499 function blocks.

## What is Runtime Enforcement?

TODO

## Example of Use

Imagine a function which inputs boolean `A` and outputs boolean `B`. 
In _easy-rte_, we present this function with the following _erte_ syntax:
```
function AB5Function;
interface of AB5Function {
	in bool A;  //in here means that they're going from PLANT to CONTROLLER
	out bool B; //out here means that they're going from CONTROLLER to PLANT
}
```

This is equivalent to the following C code, which is autogenerated, so that the function AB5Function_run can be provided by the user:
```c
//Inputs to the function AB5Function
typedef struct {
	bool A;
} inputs_AB5Function_t;

//Outputs from the function AB5Function
typedef struct {
	bool B;
} outputs_AB5Function_t;

void AB5Function_run(inputs_AB5Function_t inputs, outputs_AB5Function_t *outputs);
```

Let's now give our function the following I/O properties:
1. A and B cannot happen simultaneously.
2. A and B alternate starting with an A. 
3. B should be true within 5 ticks after an occurance of A.

We can present this as the following _easy-rte_ policy format:
```
policy AB5 of AB5Function {
	internals {
		dtimer v;
	}

	states {

		//first state is initial, and represents "We're waiting for an A"
		s0 {
			//if we receive neither A nor B, do nothing														
			-> s0 on (!A and !B): v := 0;

			//if we receive an A only, head to state s1							
			-> s1 on (A and !B): v := 0;
			
			//if we receive a B, or an A and a B (i.e. if we receive a B) then VIOLATION							
			-> violation on ((!A and B) or (A and B));	
		}

		//s1 is "we're waiting for a B, and it needs to get here within 5 ticks"
		s1 {
			//if we receive nothing, and we aren't over-time, then we do nothing														
			-> s1 on (!A and !B and v < 5);	

			//if we receive a B only, head to state s0					
			-> s0 on (!A and B);

			//if we go overtime, or we receive another A, then VIOLATION			
			-> violation on ((v >= 5) or (A and B) or (A and !B));	
		}
	}
}
```

As can be seen, this can be thought of as a simple mealy finite state machine, which provides the rules for correct operation.
A transition which goes from any state to a violation state is an error, and should be prevented.
So, we shall convert the _policy_ to an _enforcer_, which is capable of modifying the I/O such that a violation cannot occur.

The theory of converting policies to enforcers is covered in the companion paper [Runtime Enforcement of Cyber-Physical Systems](https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/citation.cfm?id=3126500).

With _easy-rte_, this process is completed automatically in two steps. Firstly, we convert the _erte_ file into an equivalent policy XML file (which makes it easier to understand, and allows portability between tools).
* `./easy-rte-parser -i example/ab5 -o example/ab5`

Then, we convert this policy XML file into an _enforcer_, which is written in C. 
* `./easy-rte-c -i example/ab5 -o example/ab5`

Now, we can provide a `main.c` file which has our controller function in it, and then compile the project together.

This entire example is provided in the `/example/ab5` folder of this repository, including an example top level file, and can be built from the root directory using `make example_ab5`.

## Build instructions

Download and install the latest version of [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Then, download this repository, and run `make`, which will generate the tools. The example can be generated using `make example`.
